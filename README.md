I have been an employee of Sandia National Laboratories for 5 years.  I hold a Bachelor of Science in Computer Engineering,
have 25 years of experience as a Software Engineer, and 8 year’s experience as a Scrum Master.  I have worked for large
corporations, government organizations, as well as small businesses.  My primary expertise is in engineering web applications
from the ground up, and have experience with monolithic, modular, and microservices-based software applications.  I currently
work in the CompSim group with the Advanced Simulation & Computing (ASC) program, which provides trustworthy scientific
software to both government and strategic partners.  I am a huge movie buff, and loves music, reading, and spicy (hot) food.
